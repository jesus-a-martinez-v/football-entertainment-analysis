# Football Entertainment Analysis #

**Welcome!** This is the source code for the entertainment analysis performed on the four main euorpean football leagues:
 * [La Liga (Spain)](https://www.ligabbva.com/).
 * [Premier League (England)](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html).
 * [Ligue 1 (France)](http://www.ligue1.com/).
 * [Serie A (Italy)](http://www.legaseriea.it/en/).
 
### What do you need? ###
In order to run the code and check the results for yourself, you'll need to make sure you have the following on your machine:
 * [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).
 * [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/).
 * [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
 * [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/).
 * [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/).
 * [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/).
 * [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).

### How to run it? ###
Easy enough! Go to your favorite terminal client and type:
```
python main.py [file_path]
```

If you want to store the resulting tables from the statistical analysis for later review, introduce the path of the file where you want to save them. If you omit this parameter, then they'll be shown in your terminal :)

### Further information ###
In the **reports** directory you'll find the research paper in PDF format (In Spanish only for the moment).
